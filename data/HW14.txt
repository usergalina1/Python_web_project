Homework:
Use the api.py module included above to create unit tests for the api function.
The api function is designed in a way which allows you to pass any parameters and any payload. If payload is passed in,
 it completely overrides the default, if additional params are passed in then they fully override all named parameters.
Create at least 10 tests.
